# 🦊 TunnelFox

**TunnelFox** is a lightweight, open-source command-line tool that allows you to create secure and private port-forwarding tunnels through a self-hosted WireGuard VPN relay.

Built for developers, self-hosters, and power users who want full control over their network — without relying on closed third-party services like Playit.gg.
